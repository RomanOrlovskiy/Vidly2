		 To get data from database instead of hard-coded values
		we have to do next :
		1) Declare a private field _context of type ApplicationDbContext.
		   This creates new DbContext(database) object.
		2) Add constructor to initialize _context.
		3) Override Dispose method.
		4) Upgrade Index action.
		5) (Manually) Add data to a Customer table in Database.

		 Section 3. Exercise 3.
		 Doing almost the same stuff as to Customers table
		 1)Creating a DbSet<Movie> property here.
		   
		 2)Add additional properties to Movie class:
			-Genre,
			-ReleaseDate,
			-Date Added,
			-Number in Stock.
			Migration, update-database.
		 3)Create another migration to populate Genres table
		   with Sql INSERT statement because it's a reference 
		   data (like MembershipType).
		 3.5) Manually add rows to Movie table
		 4)Modify MoviesController.
		 5)Modify Views.

			 /*Section 4 Exercise:         
		 1) Make a form to create a new Movie:
			- create DbSet in IdentityModels to get access to Genres table
			- create NewMovieViewModel for New action,
			- change labels of the Movie class to display properly.            
		 2) Create a button "Add Movie" on the /Index page which is a link
			to a Movies/New to create a new movie.
		 3) Create saving logic for a new movie.
		 4) Update editing logic for an existing movie.

			/*Section 5 Exercise
			  1. 3 steps for data validation:
				1) add restricting attributes on the properties of the 
				respected class, Movie in this case,
				2) use ModelState.IsValid to check whether user provided
				valid form,
				3) add validation messages in the MovieForm that will
				tell user what has gone wrong if id did,
				4) change the color of error messages,
				5) use Html.ValidationSummary().
			  2. Enable client-side validation.
			  3. Enable anti-forgery deffense.

			 * 1)Initialize mapping configuration in MappingProfile from 
			 *    Movie to MovieDto and the other way around. 
			 * 2) Create MovieDto to not rely on Movie domain model.
			 * 3) Create MoviesController in Controllers/Api folder with all necessary logic.

			 Section 7 Exercise:
			 Using jQuery and AJAX to make calls to API along side with
			 Bootbox and DataTable plug-ins for front-end.

			 Section 8 Exercise:
			 Adding Phone property to User registration includes:
			 1) adding Phone property to domain model, creating migration, 
				updating database;
			 2) changing ViewModels by adding Phone property to both RegisterViewModel
				and ExternalLoginConfirmationViewModel 
			 3)	changing the actions that are responsible to take that property
				from the user and put in the DB, like /Register and
				/ExternalLoginConfirmation in AccountController.cs
			 4) adding Phone fields to the correspoding Views (Register and 
				ExternalLoginConfirmation).


			Section 10. Building feature end-to-end.
			1. Understand the Problem.	
				The feature is going to be a rental page using which the manager
				will add to a specific customer the movies that he is renting
				when the customer check-out in the store.
				To do this, the page should provide following fields:
					- a field for customer identification of some sort(customerId),
					- a field where the manager will type the movies Ids
					  and when clicking to add the movie there will be an AJAX
					  call to the server to get the movie name and display it
					  in the list on the same page under the movieId field.
